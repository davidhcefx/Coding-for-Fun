# Offline Random Password Generator

- There are plenty of *ONLINE* websites that claimed to be generating your password *OFFLINE*. This sounds quite absurd to me, as there are no way to tell if they are collecting your data or not, unless you look into their Javascript code or something. At the end of the day, generating one's password using someone else's website just doesn't make sense. Therefore, this code is meant to be run locally and is easy to understand, which is essential to provide confidence that it is safe.


## Usage

```sh
python3 random_password_generator.py
```

## Examples
